<h1>Realistic Research: University, Web-based, and Local Resources</h1>

<p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first
 semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program who
want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, 
this lesson is designed to give students strategies which will help them
research more efficiently</p>

<p>After you read the above sections, you will be directed to a short quiz 
which will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
<p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT 
Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage.
 You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services</p>

 <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals
 and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You 
 will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin
Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at 
how to get started.</p>

<h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
<p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website
directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to 
myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." 
Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>

    <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server 
connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering 
your login information</p>

<p>Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search 
options available on the left-hand navigation bar.</p>

<p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that 
allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic 
Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>


<h2>Research Timelines</h2>
<h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
<p>It is important to first consider your due date 
when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the
material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish
your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it 
is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>

<p>
    <h4>
    <strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate
    resource into your project < Remaining time before deadline</strong>
    <h4></p>

<p>Let's unpack some of those terms

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for
        the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it 
        take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>

        <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to
        read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you 
        must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>

        <li><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project</strong>: Even
        if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify 
        pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project? 
        If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it
        to allow for discussion of this resource, or would it simply be better to 
        indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that time 
        constraints prevented you from including it?</li>

        <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is 
        left before you must turn in your project? Is your resource powerful 
        enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, 
        requesting an extension might be in order.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <h4>
    <strong>Being Realistic</strong></h4>
    <h3><strong>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one 
    day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try
    to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your 
    research timeline.</strong></h3>
</p>

<p>
    <h3><strong>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</strong></h3>
</p>

<p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been 
assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's 
decided to research the development of technical communication as a field 
between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.</p>

<p>Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching 
for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting 
some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic,
but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that
she must decide whether it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or 
to move on and look for resources that are more easily available. To do this, 
she constructs a research timeline</p>

<p>Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write 
down her timeline, but she decides to set reasonable goals and record them in her 
Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements of her project 
should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to
request any resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have 
sufficient time to wait for resources to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has
learned into her paper before she must turn in her final copy. She decides to 
read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover her
 topic as appropriate.</p>

 <h2>
    <strong>Determining the best way to obtain resources</strong>
 </h2>

 <p>Even if you can obtain a resource, that doesn't mean you necessarily should spend your time doing so. Be sure to preview a resource by reading a book review or previewing the book on Google Books to make sure that it is valuable enough to obtain. If you have determined that it is feasible and worthwhile to obtain a resource within the timeline you have developed, you must next consider how to obtain that resource.</p>

 <p>In general, the safest way to obtain resources is to physically obtain a copy yourself. However, that is often inconvenient, impractical, or unnecessary. In cases such as those, interlibrary loan or MyILL is your best option. However, interlibrary loan can take time. Consider these guidelines when requesting your resource through interlibrary loan or MyILL</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The stated turnaround time</strong></li>

    <li>Problems can and do occur in transmitting library materials. For safety's sake, ask yourself the following question: "If it were to take twice as long as the stated turnaround time on the website, would I still have enough time to utilize the research?" Consider all of the factors in the formula above. If not, seek an alternative to interlibrary loan or MyILL.</li>
    <li><strong>The proximity of the lending library to your location</strong></li>
    <li>In the case of MyILL, articles are delivered exclusively online. However, if you are using WorldCat, your lending library may be located in Wisconsin, or it may be located in Canada, or Bulgaria, or Hong Kong. While chapters might be sent electronically, it takes time for books to be delivered from WorldCat libraries. Check the location of the lending library and take it into consideration when requesting materials from WorldCat</li>
    <li><strong>The possibility that your materials may not arrive before your deadline</strong></li>
    <li>Can you complete your project without these materials? If you are still in the planning or topic selection phase, check for these materials and consider whether you will have enough time to utilize them in your project. If not, it would be wise to consider an alternative topic.</li>
</ul>
