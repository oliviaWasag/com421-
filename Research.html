<h1> How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
<p>
    <strong>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download
    </li>
    </ol>  

    <strong>You should already be familiar with:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The basic functions and tools of Excel</li>
        <li>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</li>
        <li>Research design and how to identify independent variables and dependent variables
        </li>
      </ol>  
  
  </p>

  <p>
    This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students 
    undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, 
    you will be able to to:
    <ol>
        <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
        <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
        <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
  <p>Make sure the computer you are working on 
    has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document
<a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRZF_frY7F7IDuSUGch9r7_86eb6qiq4MoL4QOkqc_JWkMEpYRbaprwEkKeiSyBXw/pubhtml>ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a>
in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.
<ol>
    <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
    <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <strong>unique identifier.</strong></li>
    <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <i>4tutorial_types</i> to <i>tutorial_types.</i></li>
    <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <i>use</i> and <i>useful</i> to <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> and <i>perc_usefulness</i>, respectively.</li>
    <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <i>Perceived Usefulness</i> and Column G refers to <i>Perceived Ease of Use.</i></li>
</ol>

    <figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
    Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.
    <ol>
        <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <i>gender</i>,
             change the "female" value to "F".</li>
        <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by
             adding new columns. For example, <i>tasks_completed</i> values 
             (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add 
             columns <i>task1, task2, and task3,</i> and reformat values appropriately.</li>
        <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, 
            then delete the old <i>tasks_completed</i> column. </li>
        <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=[1Z7b1dTogaumliJfrW7jzgKZbjXEeaNMa]" style="width:60%">
        <figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) 
      to indicate whether or not the value is represented for the given 
      subject/item. This makes the categorical values <strong>dichotomous</strong>, 
      which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for 
      relationships or correlations.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of 
        characteristics for analysis. For example, separating experience
        levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects 
        with low experience have perceived ease of use scores significantly 
        different from those with medium and high experience levels.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
        <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <strong>Insert > Columns</strong>
            for each distinct value in categorical data columns 
            (<i>tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, and task3</i>). 
            You do not have to add a new column for <i>task1, task2, and task3</i> 
            because their values are already dichotomous.</li>
        <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. 
            Copy and paste the values from the original column.</li>
        <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) 
            using the replace function: <strong>Edit > Replace.</strong></li>
        <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=[1Z7b1dTogaumliJfrW7jzgKZbjXEeaNMa]" style="width:60%">
        <figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
      </figure>

</p>

<h2>Run descriptive statistics</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new 
        questions. For example, <i>perc_enjoy</i> is much higher on average 
        than <i>perc_usefulness</i>, which also has a large variance. This 
        suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the 
        system useful even though they enjoyed using it</strong>
</p>
<p>
Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results 
in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, 
those with continuous values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the <strong>continuous</strong> 
values of <i>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness,</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> are already adjacent.)
Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary,
 making sure not to include variable labels

</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins</strong>... and make sure 
            <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics.</strong> Click OK.</li>
        <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. 
Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to 
the variables. For example, <i>Column 1</i> should be <i>perc_enjoy.</i> Your 
Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset
before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you
glean from the summary statistics for <i>perc_usefulness</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i>?

         characters, so the variable labels must be re-entered.</figcaption>
