<h1> How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
<p>
    <strong>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download
    </li>
    </ol>  

    <strong>You should already be familiar with:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The basic functions and tools of Excel</li>
        <li>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</li>
        <li>Research design and how to identify independent variables and dependent variables
        </li>
      </ol>  
  
  </p>

  <p>
    This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students 
    undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, 
    you will be able to to:
    <ol>
        <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
        <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
        <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
  <p>Make sure the computer you are working on 
    has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document
<a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRZF_frY7F7IDuSUGch9r7_86eb6qiq4MoL4QOkqc_JWkMEpYRbaprwEkKeiSyBXw/pubhtml>ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a>
in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.
<ol>
    <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
    <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <strong>unique identifier.</strong></li>
    <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <i>4tutorial_types</i> to <i>tutorial_types.</i></li>
    <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <i>use</i> and <i>useful</i> to <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> and <i>perc_usefulness</i>, respectively.</li>
    <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <i>Perceived Usefulness</i> and Column G refers to <i>Perceived Ease of Use.</i></li>
</ol>
