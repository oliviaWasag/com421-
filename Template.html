    <div style="margin-right: 40%">
    <p>This space can be used to write your main content in it can be as short or as long as you'll like.
        <u>It is spaced out nicely becuase I used the margin function that works with HTML and CSS</u>
        I will paste in a random passage now.
    </p>
    <p>“What I like doing best is Nothing."</p>

       <p>"How do you do Nothing," asked Pooh after he had wondered for a long time.</p> 
        
       <p> "Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it, 'What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?' and you say, 'Oh, Nothing,' and then you go and do it.
        
        It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."
        
        "Oh!" said Pooh.”</p>
