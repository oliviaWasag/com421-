    <h1> Title Goes Here!</h1>

    <aside>
      <p> <strong> Another cool function is the "aside" function! It helps create these cool side bars. You can customize them to any side of the screen, any size, and any shapw you desire! Very cool way to catch the interest of your crowd.</strong></p>
    </aside>
    <div style="margin-right: 40%">
    <p>This space can be used to write your main content in it can be as short or as long as you'll like.
        <u>It is spaced out nicely becuase I used the margin function that works with HTML and CSS</u>
        I will paste in a random passage now.
    </p>
    <p>“What I like doing best is Nothing."</p>

       <p>"How do you do Nothing," asked Pooh after he had wondered for a long time.</p> 
        
       <p> "Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it, 'What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?' and you say, 'Oh, Nothing,' and then you go and do it.
        
        It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."
        
        "Oh!" said Pooh.”</p>
       <p><cite> ― A.A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh</cite></p>

        <font size="+1">
        <ul>
            <li>you can write your paragraphs with the "p" function.</li>
            <li>underline items with the "u" function.</li>
            <li>cite titles with the "cite" function.</li>
            <li>create ordered or unordered lists with the "ul" or "ol" function.</li>
        </ul> 
        Feel free to delete all of these paragraphs and insert your own.

<section>
    <p>
        A great way to organize your code with with the "section" function. It helps you when you want to move the flow of your website. It is much 
        cleaner to move the entire section then possibly missing lines!

    <figure>
        <img src="ImagesforCom/lp_image.jpeg" style="width:300px;height:400px;" >  
        <figcaption>Inserting pictures are always fun!  This caption was created with the "figcaption" function </figcaption>  

    <p>Feel free to replace the photo with whichever one you would like. This one is just my dog!
        You download the photo onto your computer and then upload the link! Like the aside boxes you can also style them with
            CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally insert any link you'll like by writing the command "a href= (weblink)" "then title the weblink!"
